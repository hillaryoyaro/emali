# AI-Powered Visual Search E-commerce Project - Video Script

## Introduction (2 minutes)

**[Title Slide: "AI-Powered Visual Search E-commerce for Fashion"]**

Have you ever seen a clothing item you liked but didn't know how to describe it in words? That's where visual search comes in! In this video, we demonstrate how to build an AI-powered visual search engine that allows users to upload an image, and through AI, find similar items in a product catalog.

But we don't stop there - we'll also automatically detect product categories and dominant colors from images, enabling powerful filtering capabilities.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll build a Visual search system with

1. Automatic product categorization
2. Color detection and filtering
3. And a beautiful, responsive user interface

Let's dive in!

## How to Run the Project with Docker (3 minutes)

**[Slide: "Running the Project with Docker"]**

Before we develop the project, let's see how easy it is to run the complete application using Docker. If you've already cloned the repository, you can get everything up and running with just one single command.

First, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Then, open a terminal in the project root directory and run:cam

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This single command will:

1. Build both the frontend and backend containers
2. Set up all necessary volumes for data persistence
3. Install all dependencies automatically
4. Start the services in the correct order

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000, and the backend API will run on http://localhost:8000.

The first time you run this, it might take several minutes as it downloads AI models and dependencies. Let's look at what happens in the background:

**[Show docker-compose.yml file]**

Our docker-compose file defines two main services:

- The frontend container, running Next.js
- The backend container, running FastAPI with our AI models

We also define persistent volumes for:

- ML model cache: so we don't download large models every time
- Image cache: for storing processed product images
- Data volume: for the database and other persistent data

## Project Development Overview (2 minutes)

**[Slide: "Development Overview"]**

Now that we know how to run the project, let's understand the development workflow. This project is divided into two main parts:

1. The Python backend (FastAPI):

   - Handles product data management
   - Processes images using AI models
   - Provides search and filtering APIs
   - Runs category and color detection

2. The Next.js frontend:
   - Presents a user-friendly interface
   - Handles image uploads
   - Manages search and filter interactions
   - Displays product results

For development, you'll want to run these components separately:

For the backend:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

For the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Let's now look at the inputs and outputs of this project to better understand its architecture.

## Project Inputs and Outputs (3 minutes)

**[Slide: "Project Inputs and Outputs"]**

The main input to our system is a `products.json` file, which contains basic product information. Let's examine its structure:

**[Show products.json snippet]**

Each product has:

- A unique ID
- Name
- Price
- Image URL

Notice what's missing? There's no category or color information! Our system will automatically detect these attributes using AI.

The backend processes this input to:

1. Download and cache product images
2. Extract features for visual similarity search
3. Detect product categories using a trained fashion classifier
4. Identify dominant colors using color analysis
5. Store all this information in a SQLite database

The frontend then:

1. Displays products in a visually appealing grid
2. Provides text and image search capabilities
3. Offers category and color filtering
4. Shows search results with relevant products

Let's dive deeper into the backend implementation.

## Backend Implementation (10 minutes)

**[Slide: "Backend Architecture"]**

Our backend is built with FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for Python. The main components are:

1. **Data Management**: Loading products from JSON, database operations
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting images to feature vectors for similarity search
3. **Fashion Classification**: Identifying product categories from images
4. **Color Analysis**: Detecting dominant colors
5. **API Endpoints**: Serving data to the frontend

Let's start by looking at how we initialize our models:

**[Show initialization code from main.py]**

When the application starts, we:

1. Initialize the database
2. Load the ML models for feature extraction and classification
3. Process all products from the JSON file
4. Extract features and detect categories and colors
5. Store everything in the database

Now let's look at the key API endpoints:

**[Show API endpoint code]**

We have three main endpoints:

1. `/api/products`: Returns all products with their attributes
2. `/api/search/text`: Performs text-based product search
3. `/api/search/image`: Handles visual search from uploaded images

The most interesting endpoint is the image search. When a user uploads an image, we:

1. Extract features from the uploaded image
2. Compare these features with our database of product features
3. Calculate similarity scores using cosine similarity
4. Return products above a certain similarity threshold

Now let's look at how we detect product categories:

**[Show fashion classification code]**

We use a pre-trained model that classifies fashion items into categories like:

- Tops: t-shirts, blouses, sweaters
- Bottoms: pants, jeans, skirts
- Outerwear: jackets, coats
- Footwear: shoes, boots, sneakers
- Accessories: bags, hats, belts

For color detection, we analyze the image to find dominant colors:

**[Show color detection code]**

This extracts the most prominent color from each image and classifies it into standard color names like "red", "blue", "black", etc.

All this processed information enables powerful filtering capabilities on the frontend.

## Frontend Implementation (10 minutes)

**[Slide: "Frontend Architecture"]**

Our frontend is built with Next.js, a React framework that provides a great developer experience with features like server-side rendering and static site generation.

The main components are:

1. **Page Component**: The main page where everything is organized
2. **Header**: Contains the search functionality
3. **ProductGrid**: Displays products in a responsive grid
4. **Sidebar**: Provides filtering options
5. **API Service**: Communicates with the backend

Let's start by looking at the main page component:

**[Show page.tsx code]**

The Home component manages:

1. Product state and filtering
2. Search functionality (text and image)
3. Category and color filter management

When the page loads, it fetches all products from the backend:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const loadProducts = async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    const data = await fetchProducts()
    setProducts(data)
    setFilteredProducts(data)
    setLoading(false)
  }

  loadProducts()
}, [])
```

And applies filters when the user selects categories or colors:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let filtered = [...products]

  if (selectedCategory) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(
      (product) => product.category === selectedCategory
    )
  }

  if (selectedColor) {
    filtered = filtered.filter((product) => product.color === selectedColor)
  }

  setFilteredProducts(filtered)
}, [products, selectedCategory, selectedColor])
```

Now let's examine the image search functionality:

**[Show image search code from Header component]**

The Header component includes an image upload button that:

1. Accepts image files from the user
2. Previews the selected image
3. Sends the image to the backend for visual search
4. Displays the search results

Let's also look at how we communicate with the backend:

**[Show API service code]**

Our API service handles:

1. Fetching all products
2. Text search requests
3. Image upload and visual search

For image search, we create a FormData object to send the file:

```typescript
export const searchByImage = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData()
  formData.append('file', file)

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/search/image`, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    })
    return await response.json()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error searching by image:', error)
    return []
  }
}
```

## Dockerizing the Project (3 minutes)

**[Slide: "Dockerizing the Project"]**

Now let's look at how we containerize both parts of the application.

For the backend, we have a Dockerfile that:

1. Uses a Python base image
2. Installs dependencies
3. Sets up the application directory
4. Exposes the API port
5. Runs the FastAPI server

**[Show backend Dockerfile]**

For the frontend, we have a Dockerfile that:

1. Uses a Node.js base image
2. Installs dependencies
3. Builds the Next.js application
4. Runs the production server

**[Show frontend Dockerfile]**

And our docker-compose.yml ties everything together:

1. Defines both services
2. Maps ports for access
3. Sets up volumes for persistence
4. Defines service dependencies

This containerization approach makes deployment easy and consistent across different environments.
