# AI-Powered Visual Search E-commerce for Fashion

## Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Simplified Version

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

Create a simple e-commerce platform for fashion that allows users to search for products using either text or images. Users can upload photos of fashion items they like, and the platform will use AI to find visually similar products from the catalog.

### 1.2 Target Audience

- Fashion shoppers who prefer visual discovery
- Users who find inspiration from social media, magazines, or street fashion

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of three main components:

1. **Frontend Application**: Next.js-based web application
2. **Backend API**: Python-based REST API
3. **AI Visual Search Engine**: Machine learning model for image similarity

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Database**: Simple JSON or SQLite database (for product data)
- **AI/ML**: Pre-trained model for the visual search

```

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Web Page (Week 1)

- Set up project repositories and development environment
- Create a simple web page with:
  - Header with logo
  - Search bar (text input + image upload button)
  - Product listing grid

### Phase 2: Text Search Implementation (Week 2)

- Implement basic text search functionality
- Create a simple database with product name, price, and image
- Display search results based on product name matches

### Phase 3: AI Model Development (Week 3)

- Implement image preprocessing
- Set up a pre-trained model for image feature extraction
- Develop simple vector similarity search

### Phase 4: Image Search Integration (Week 4)

- Implement image upload functionality
- Connect the AI model with the backend
- Display search results based on image similarity

## 4. Feature Specifications

### 4.1 Core Features

#### Simple Web Page

- **Header**: Logo and simple navigation
- **Search Bar**: Text input field and image upload button
- **Product Listing**: Grid display of all products with name, price, and image

#### Text Search

- Basic text search that matches product names
- Display relevant products in the product grid

#### Visual Search

- Image upload functionality
- AI processing to find visually similar products
- Display results in the same product grid format

### 4.2 Data Model

**Products**:

- product_id
- name
- price
- image_url

## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### 5.1 AI Model Approach

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use a pre-trained CNN model
   - Extract feature vectors from product images
   
2. **Similarity Search**:
   - Calculate similarity between uploaded image and product images
   - Return products sorted by similarity score

### 5.2 API Endpoints

- `GET /api/products` - List all products
- `GET /api/search/text?query=<text>` - Search products by name
- `POST /api/search/image` - Upload an image and get similar products

## 6. Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### 6.1 Challenges

- Ensuring accurate image similarity matching
- Handling image uploads efficiently
- Providing fast search results

### 6.2 Solutions

- Use a well-established pre-trained model for image feature extraction
- Implement efficient image processing
- Keep the database small and focused

## 7. Success Metrics

- Search accuracy for both text and image search
- Page load and search response times
- User engagement with the search features

## 8. Development Timeline

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Basic Web Page | Project setup, Web page with header, search bar, and product grid |
| 2 | Text Search | Text search functionality, Simple product database |
| 3 | AI Model | Image feature extraction, Similarity calculation |
